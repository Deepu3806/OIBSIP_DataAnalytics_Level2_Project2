🍷 Wine Quality Prediction – Data Analytics-Level 2-Project 2

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics using machine learning techniques. By analyzing attributes such as acidity, density, and alcohol content, the model classifies wine as good or bad quality. The project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

🎯 Objectives
